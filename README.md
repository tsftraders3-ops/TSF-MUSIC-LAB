# TSF Music v3.2 — MINDBEAT

**A standalone, cross-platform (Android + iOS) music app with a Spotify-grade
interface and a learning, on-device intelligence engine.**
No server. No setup. No account. Install the APK and it works.

Music streams at **320 kbps** straight from the device via direct JioSaavn
API calls (DES-decrypted on-device) with an iTunes preview fallback —
React Native talks to the APIs directly, so there are no CORS proxies, no
backends, nothing to host. Every AI feature runs **100% on the device**:
no LLM APIs, no analytics, no telemetry — your listening history never
leaves the phone.

> **Install**: grab `app-release.apk` from the latest release
> (https://github.com/mua47105-hue/TSF-MUSIC/releases) and sideload it.
> Builds are signed with the same keystore, so updates install in place.

## What's inside

### The player
- **320 kbps playback** with background audio, notification and lock-screen
  controls (react-native-track-player)
- **Stale-URL auto-recovery**: expired CDN links are silently refetched and
  re-decrypted mid-session
- Real queue control: play next, add to queue, remove from queue, shuffle,
  repeat
- **Downloads for offline** — resolved streams are saved into the app's
  private document directory and play back forever
- Share sheet, per-track long-press menu, toast feedback for every action

### MINDBEAT — the on-device intelligence (v3.0+)
Every play, skip, like and download becomes **graded evidence** in a local
event ledger, and the app learns from it:

| Surface | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Smart Shuffle v2** | AI picks interleaved into your queue, vibe-locked to the current session; skipping a rec re-seeds the next one away from what you rejected ("it's listening back") |
| **Autoplay Radio v2** | When the queue runs dry, a multi-seed station keeps playing — even with the UI killed — drifting between mood cells inside your artist clusters |
| **Daily Mixes v2** | Cluster-cross mixes (artist cluster × mood cell) with a 60/25/15 core/bridge/fresh split, re-ranked nightly and after every third session |
| **Now Sound (daylist)** | A time-aware playlist: your 11pm and your 11am get different names and different tracks ("Midnight Riyaz", "Gym-time Bhangra") |
| **On the Rise** | Seed-of-seed discovery: neighbors of your co-play neighbors, filtered to never-played tracks, each with an honest "via artist" chain |
| **AI Playlist Generator** | Type a vibe ("Punjabi gym bangers", "90s heartbreak Bollywood", Hinglish works) → five-stage pipeline (Understand → Hunt → Curate → Polish → Narrate) → 25-track playlist with a name and description |
| **Vibe Search** | The search bar's NLP mode: "songs like kun faya kun", typo-tolerant ("sahd songs"), intent chips on the results |
| **Your Sound v2** | Wrapped-grade stats with the industry 30-second rule, listening clock, streaks and skip profile |
| **Taste DNA** | The transparency screen: see the entire model — affinity weights, the daypart matrix, exploration budget — and act on it (Boost / Mute / Not-for-me / export JSON / kill switch) |

Every recommendation carries a **truthful reason line** from a closed code
set — the app never invents an explanation. See
[docs/MINDBEAT.md](docs/MINDBEAT.md) for the full six-layer architecture.

### First-run onboarding (v3.2)
Spotify-faithful three-step flow:
1. **"What's your name?"** — powers the "Made for {name}" shelf
2. **"Choose 3 or more artists you like."** — **real artist photos**
   (48 verified A-lister seeds + unbounded "More" batches across 8 live
   categories + artist search), circular avatars with white-ring selection
3. **"What kind of music do you like?"** — colorful genre tiles

Completion is **permanent**: the flag is dual-written (SQLite + AsyncStorage)
before the flow closes, and a mid-flow kill resumes instead of restarting.
Your picks seed the taste profile immediately.

### The interface
- Authentic Spotify Android design language, pixel-verified against
  genuine reference screenshots (green-active filter chips, 8-tile shortcut
  grid, #282828 mini-player card, plain-white play glyph, 4-tab bar with
  Premium)
- **The app repaints itself per song**: artwork colors are extracted in
  pure JS (jpeg-js quantizer, no native module) and drive the player
  gradient, collection headers and accent surfaces
- **Deep Home feed**: shortcuts → Made for {name} → Now Sound → Jump back
  in → Popular artists (real-photo rail) → Trending → On the Rise →
  Because you listened → New releases → Featured playlists → charts
  — JioSaavn's editorial feed keeps the screen populated from the very
  first session
- Search: Spotify's Top-result hero card over a Songs list, 18-category
  Browse grid, recent searches, Keyword|Vibe toggle
- Library: playlists / artists / albums / downloaded filters, list⇄grid
  view toggle, Liked Songs gradient hero
- "What's new" dialog on every update + an on-screen version badge, so
  releases are visibly verifiable on the device

### Content safety
Explicit/abusive content never appears on Home or any algorithmic surface:
provider explicit flags plus a word-boundary profanity blocklist
(English + Hindi/Punjabi romanized). Search results honor user intent and
show an "E" badge instead. The filter is tested against a dodge corpus.

### Privacy
- The ledger stores **no URLs, device ids or identifiers** (verifier-tested)
- Everything lives in app-private storage; nothing is uploaded anywhere
- Kill switch: disable all recommendations (persists across restarts);
  export or reset the model from Taste DNA

## Build & run

```bash
bun install
bun run typecheck        # tsc --noEmit (strict)
bun test                 # 74 AI replay tests incl. latency budgets
bunx expo start          # dev server
bunx expo run:android    # native debug build
```

### Release (CI)

GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/native-android.yml`) on every push to
`main`: stamps a monotonic `versionCode`, runs `expo prebuild`, builds a
**signed release APK** from the secret keystore and attaches it as an
artifact. Pushing a `v*` tag publishes a GitHub Release.

```bash
git tag v3.3.0 && git push origin v3.3.0   # → release APK in ~15 min
```

APKs are deep-verified after each release (manifest version probe, Hermes
bundle markers, webmock-leak check — `scripts/verify_v32_apk.py` is the
latest example).

### Visual QA — the device lab

```bash
bash scripts/lab.sh
```

Boots Expo web with react-native-web, redirects the data/player layers to
fixtures (`src/webmocks/` + `metro.config.js` — **Android builds are
unaffected**), then runs a Playwright walkthrough on hardware-faithful
Pixel 7 and iPhone 13 viewports: onboarding → reload-persistence
regression → deep home scroll → search → player → queue. Screenshots land
in `screenshots/`; `scripts/package_ui_shots.py` builds the browsable
gallery committed at `download/tsf-ui-screenshots/`.
